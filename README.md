- **Docker Containerization:** The application is containerized using Docker to ensure consistent deployment, scalability, and isolation across different environments.
- **Docker Compose Deployment:** Simplifies deployment with Docker Compose configuration, enabling easy setup and service orchestration without complex commands.
- **Log Scraping:** Preconfigured scraping of container logs using Promtail or a similar agent.
- **Persistent Configuration:** Uses bind mounts to store Loki config and logs on the host machine.
- **Network Compatibility:** Uses shared Docker network to work with other monitoring tools.
- **Traefik Integration:** Promtail collects logs directly from Traefik, enabling easy monitoring of your reverse proxy activity.
- **Loki Integration:** Logs are pushed to Loki, which store logs and serves to Grafana to create visually appealing dashboards.
- **Grafana Integration:** Promtail integrates smoothly with Grafana for visualizing access logs.
