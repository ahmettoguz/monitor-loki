- **Docker Containerization:** The application is containerized using Docker to ensure consistent deployment, scalability, and isolation across different environments.
- **Docker Compose Deployment:** Simplifies deployment with Docker Compose configuration, enabling easy setup and service orchestration without complex commands.
- **Persistent Data:** Utilizes a named Docker volume to ensure persistent storage of application data, allowing data to persist across container restarts, rebuilds, and removals.
- **Network Compatibility:** Uses shared Docker network to work with other monitoring tools.
- **.env Configuration:** All environment variables are easily configurable using the `.env` file, simplifying configuration management.
- **Log Scraping:** Preconfigured scraping configuration for Promtail.
- **Traefik Integration:** Promtail collects logs directly from Traefik and push to Loki, enabling easy monitoring of your reverse proxy activity.
- **Grafana Integration:** Loki integrates smoothly with Grafana for visualizing access logs.
